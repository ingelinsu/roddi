conda create --name roddi
conda activate roddi

# Later versions of python lacks cvxopt
conda install python=3.8.5

# These channels contains libraries we need.
# You can omit this and use the -c flag, but
# this makes it automatically available.
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels anaconda

# Install all the libraries we need.
conda install django
